[NCDU](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) is a tool, utilizing [NCurses](https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/), creates a more user-friendly TUI similar to the purpose of the more well-known tool `du`.
`godu` aims to implement a similar functionality using [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).

## Running the code (so far)
I have an example of Bubble Tea in fullscreen mode here: `go run main.go`

## File Structure
```

To quickly go through the intentions and thoughts here:

### ~~cmd~~
~~This will contain the main function and only the main function.~~

Removing `cmd` directory in favor of using simply `main.go` in the root directory.

### internal
Contains most of the code. Will probably need to have directories added accordingly that organizes the different functionalities better.

### docs
As good stewards, docs should be provided; at the minimum autogenerated docs.
