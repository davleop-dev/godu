# godu
[NCDU](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) is a tool, utilizing [NCurses](https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/), creates a more user-friendly TUI similar to the purpose of the more well-known tool `du`.
`godu` aims to implement a similar functionality using [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).

#### @prescient-slime: "Just GoDu it"

## Running the code (so far)
I have an example of Bubble Tea in fullscreen mode here: `go run main.go`

## File Structure
```
.
├── docs
└── internal
    ├── du
    └── tui
```

To quickly go through the intentions and thoughts here:

### internal
#### du
Contains code related to reading, writing, and deleting files.

#### tui
Relevant code related to the TUI. Anything visually shown to the user should be placed in this directory.

### docs
As good stewards, docs should be provided; at the minimum autogenerated docs.
